    Lunar Lander #WCCChallenge "Pump"
    https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2711492
    
    Also on github at https://github.com/nbogie/lunar-lander-p5js
	 
    This is a quick attempt at implementing a "lunar-lander"/"thrust" style game.
    So far, the pump theme isn't very strong in this one, but I though i'd submit for fun as I did write it for the challenge.     
    
    Currently, there's: 
      * fuel pumped from the tank to the ship,    
      * pump association with the winds that blow across the moon,
      (I can't decide how much atmosphere is, here!)
    
    Slow frame-rate?  
    If you're getting a frame rate below 60FPS, consider disabling wind with 'w' - wind is the main burden.
    (You can also enter zen mode with 'z')

	 If you're curious, on the github repo, there is a work-in-progress branch there that allows you to fly into a the cavern.
